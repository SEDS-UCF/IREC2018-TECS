# IREC2018-TECS Code
Build and install `RTIMULib2` using CMake and `./configure`, `make`, and `make install` in `bcm2835-1.52`.

After the above libraries are installed, `make` inside `lib` to build the RadioHead library locally.

Then `make` in this directory to build the TECS, and `./payload` or `./radio` to run the appropriate program.
